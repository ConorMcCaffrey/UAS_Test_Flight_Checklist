# UAS_Test_Flight_Checklist
Generic test flight checklist for UAS (Drones)


This checklist is meant to be used to inspect a (potentially unknown) drone before test flights. It is particularly useful for catching issues that will occur during tuning and validation flights.

This checklist has been created in the course of test flying many different types of unmanned systems. Including fixed wing aircraft, multirotor aircraft, hybrid aerial and submersible craft, hydrogen fuel cell powered aircraft, gas piston powered hybrids, tethered multi-rotors, and many more.

If you have items or instructions that you think should be added to this checklist please submit them or send a message. Every incident is a learning oppurtunity that shouldn't be wasted.
